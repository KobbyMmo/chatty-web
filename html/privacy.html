        <div class="intro">Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA. Hence, we’ve aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.</div>
        <div class="intro">
cHATTY provides direct messaging, group messaging, file sharing and other services to users around the world.  Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information (including message) practices. For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you. </div>
<div class="intro">
When we say “cHATTY,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about cHATTY Inc. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.
</div>
<div class="intro">
Please also read cHATTY’s Terms of Service (“Terms”), which describes the terms under which you use our Services.

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 faq-item">
            <div class="question">Your Messages</div>
            <div class="answer">We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages (including your chats, photos, videos and files) are delivered, they are deleted from our servers. Your messages are stored on your own device. If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it. To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services, which is on by default, when you and the people with whom you message use a version of our app released after April 2, 2016. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.

Small Claims Court. As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.
Time Limit to Start Arbitration. We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose; otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred. This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.
